Once upon a time, in a dense forest, there lived a wise old owl. Every night, he would perch on his favorite branch and watch over the forest creatures. The other animals often came to him for advice, as he had seen many seasons come and go.

One particularly cold winter evening, a young rabbit hopped up to his tree. "Wise owl," the rabbit called, "I'm worried about the coming frost. What should I do to stay warm?"

The owl thought for a moment, then spoke softly, "My dear friend, look around you. See how the squirrels have gathered leaves and twigs? They know that preparation is key. Gather soft materials for your burrow, and you'll stay cozy through the coldest nights."

The rabbit thanked the owl and hopped away, ready to follow the wise advice. From that day on, the rabbit had the warmest burrow in the forest, and never forgot the owl's wisdom about planning ahead.
